# Brief example of using HeatWave AutoML and Lakehouse on AWS for predicting BOAT_SPEED of a Catamaran F50 Sail Grand Prix

### In this notebook, we will demonstrate the power of combining Heatwave database platform with a Lakehouse architecture and AutoML for predictive analytics. 
### We will be working with data from the catamaran F-50, which is equipped with IoT sensors capturing various parameters in a data lake of data in the object storage. Our goal is to predict the ## boat speed using an AutoML's machine learning regression model.

### By leveraging Heatwave, we can efficiently run analytics and machine learning workloads directly on lakehouse / object storage data. Heatwave provides unparalleled performance and scalability, enabling us to derive valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. 
### With AutoML, we can automate the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning, accelerating our time-to-value and delivering accurate predictions.

### By predicting the boat speed accurately, we can optimize performance, enhance decision-making, and improve overall operational efficiency. 
### The insights gained from this predictive model can be applied to various use cases, such as racing 
### strategy optimization, fuel efficiency, and real-time performance monitoring.
